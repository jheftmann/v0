# XXIX

## Developing
[The site](http://xxix.smallvictories.tk) is compiled with the [Small Victories gem](http://github.com/xxix/smallvictories-gem).

The index file is compiled from `_sv/index.liquid` and compiled into the root as
`index.html`. Liquid partials are included from `_sv/templates`.

Sass is compiled from `_sv/application.scss` and compiled into the root as
`application.css`. Sass partials are sourced from `_sv/_partials`.

Javascript is compiled from `_sv/application.js` and compiled into the root as
`application.js`.

Third party libraries are included using [Sprockets](https://github.com/rails/sprockets).
